# Education:
B.S., in Physics Honors, 2016, Purdue University

M.S., in Physics, 2018, Bowling Green State University


# Research Interests: Computational physics/astronomy.
I am working with Professor Evan Schneider to further develop Cholla, a code for simulating astrophysical hydrodynamics. Cholla is a 3D hydrodynamics code that uses GPU's in parallel to greatly accelerate solving the equations of hydrodynamics. I am working on adding magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) to Cholla to allow us to simulate the affects of electromagnetic fields on galactic winds. This will lay the groundwork for adding cosmic rays to the model in the future.
