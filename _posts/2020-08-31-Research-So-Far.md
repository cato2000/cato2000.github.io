# Overview

This is my first post so I'm going to summarize what I've done this year and
what my plans are for the near future.

I spent the spring semester mostly taking taking classes. When I had time I
worked on learning C++, expanding my Bash scripting skills, and building a repo
for my dotfiles[^dotfiles]. This summer I've been learning about numerical
hydrodynamics and how to implement a code that solves the Euler equations in 1D
using second-order Gudonov methods.

# Learning C++
I mostly learned C++ using Kate Gregory's Pluralsight class on basic C++
supplemented with "Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example" by Koenig
and Moo. Kate Gregory's class was ok, it wasn't really broad or in depth enough
for what I needed and was clearly directed at computer scientists does "medium"
performance computing, i.e. game development and the like. "Accelerated C++" was
a better learning tool but it is not for beginner programmers; it is suitable
for someone who is an intermediate program but isn't familiar with C++.

I ended up choosing Visual Studio Code as my IDE for C++ development since no
other IDE supported C++, CUDA, and HIP; plus the extensibility of VSCode is a
huge plus. The GPGPU support in VSCode is pretty lacluster but it does work well
for developing on remote machines which is a huge plus.

As a part of this I also learned how to use Doxygen for C++ code documentation.
It's excellent and I've been using it for all my projects.


# Cholla
On and off throughout the spring and early summer I got Cholla up and running on
Pitts H2P cluster. This was a good way to refresh on using batch systems and
I found a bug in how Cholla chooses whether to use 32 or 64 bit floats. My fix
unfortunately broke some other stuff and it's almost never run with 32 bit
floats so we're ignoring that for now. I did submit a pull request to fix a
bunch of typos and a few similar errors. I plan on working more on Cholla once
I'm ready to start implementing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) later this year or
early next.

I also attended the OLCF new users workshop and it was very useful.

# Hydrodynamics and Simulations
This was my first real dive into numerical simlation and took up the bulk of my
summer. My past programming has all been data analysis of some variate so as you
might expect I have a lot to learn. I started by reading the first several
chapters (up to the end basic Gudonov methods) in "Computational Gas Dynamics"
by Laney, "Introduction to Computational Astrophysical Hydrodynamics" by
Zingale, and "Riemann Solvers and Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics" by Toro;
I mostly followed along with Zingale since it was the easiest to follow. During
this time I wrote programs to solve the Advection and Burgers equations as a
stepping stone to a full Euler equations solver. These simplier, single equation
solvers were a great way to start learning about numerical simulations and my
implementations of them can be found in the `basic-solvers` directory of my
[hydro-sandbox](https://github.com/bcaddy/hydro-sandbox) repo. They are solved
using second order in both space and time and use Minmod or MC slope limiters

Writing a full solver for the Euler equations was a much larger endevour. This
solver is basically made up of two parts: one that computes the slopes, time
steps, reconstructs interface states, etc and a Riemann solver. My first step
was writing the Riemann solver, instead of using an approximate solver I
implemented the exact Riemann solver from Toro. This exact Riemann solver is
used to determine the state of a hydrodynamics system that has a discontinuity
in it, much like you find at each cell interface. Unfortunately the exact
Riemann solver is fairly complicated so I took about a week and make a flowchart
of it in \( \latex \). This helped clarify it to me and made it far easier for
me to implement the Riemann solver.

Once the Riemann solver was written and tested it was time to write the whole
simulation code for the Euler equations. I decided to implement this using an
object oriented paradigm since I need practice with that and this algorith is a
good candidate for object oriented pragramming (OOP); due to the many funtions
that can (and should) be hidden from the main function. I wrote one class for
the Riemann solver, one for the grid, and one for the simulation itself. Then
all the main function has to do is call various methods of the simulation class.
This general idea worked very well however I had to do large refactors, nearly
rewrites, twice. Once because I was storing everything as primitive variables
(density, velocity, and pressure) instead of conserved variables (density,
momentum, and energy), this is a problem because it makes the conservative
update hard and it doesn't extend well to MHD. The second rewrite was because I
was iteration over cell interfaces and computing the updates one cell at a time.
This doesn't work because you end up computing the same flux multiple times,
this is both inefficient and can lead to numerical instability. After these
refactors the code was significantly easier to read and understand. Between the
complexity of the code, the multiple refactors, and hunting tricky bugs this
took me about two months to do. During the debugging phase of this project I
also learned how to use GDB to debug C++ code and how to hook it into VSCode.
The details of the Euler solver can be found in the `euler-solver` directory of
my [hydro-sandbox](https://github.com/bcaddy/hydro-sandbox) repo.

As a part of writing this code I also wrote some python programs to generate
animations of the output of the various solvers I wrote. These scripts used the
matplotlib.animate library and were invaluable in diagnosing errors and
presenting my work and a gallery of them is at the end of this post. They can be
found in the `visualization` directory of my
[hydro-sandbox](https://github.com/bcaddy/hydro-sandbox) repo.


# Miscellanous Other Projects
- Put together a personal website and research blog
- Wrote a CV and update my resume
- Attended department workshops on python, numpy, and visualizations
- Attended Oakridge National Lab's (ORNL) OLCF new users training, i.e. how to
  use ORNL's computing resources

## Advection Equation
Here's the result of solving the Advection equation with a step function initial conditions. Note the little "ears" on the profile, this is caused by the unlimited slopes that are being used.
![Advection equation, no limiting](/assets/img/2020-post-assets/08-august/advection-top-hat-no-limiting.mp4)

This is the same advection simulations but now with MC limiting. Notice how the "ears" are completely gone and the profile much more resembles the initial profile, just advected to the right.
![Advection equation, limited](/assets/img/2020-post-assets/08-august/advection-top-hat-MC-limiting.mp4)

## Burgers Equation
In these animations you will see the solution to the Burgers' Equation with sinosoidal initial conditions and different slope limiters. The first is with MC limiting, this can be considered the fiducial result
![Burgers equation, MC limiting](/assets/img/2020-post-assets/08-august/Burgers-MC-Limiter.mp4)

Now we create the same plot but with just a forward difference. Note the oscillations near the back of the sign wave
![Burgers equation, no limiting, forward](/assets/img/2020-post-assets/08-august/Burgers-forward-diff.mp4)

Now we create the same plot but with just a backward difference. Note the oscillations near the front of the sign wave
![Burgers equation, no limiting, backward](/assets/img/2020-post-assets/08-august/Burgers-backward-diff.mp4)

And finally with a centered difference. Even though a centered difference is technically second order accurate you can see how important limiting is to getting a physically realizable result
![Burgers equation, no limiting, centered](/assets/img/2020-post-assets/08-august/Burgers-centered-diff.mp4)

## Euler's Equations
Now here are the results for the full Euler Equations solver.

The first animation shows a simply advecting density wave using a piecewise constant method to reconstruct the interface states. Note how quickly the profile goes from a step function to a guassian and then how quickly it dissapates.
![Euler equation, PCM](/assets/img/2020-post-assets/08-august/euler-advection-PCM.mp4)

This is the same initial conditions but now we're using Zingales piecewise linear method with MC limited slopes. Now how much less dissapative the advection is.
![Euler equation, PLM](/assets/img/2020-post-assets/08-august/euler-advection-PCM.mp4)

Finally the standard test of any Euler solving code, the Sod shock tube. The code reproduces the correct profile with only very small deviations, and this is with only 100 cells. With more cells it's even more accurate
