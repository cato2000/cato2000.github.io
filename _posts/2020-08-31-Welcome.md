This is my personal website and research blog. Here you will find what I'm
working on, some information about me, and my CV/resume.

If you're interested in my research, contact info, CV/resume, etc please check
out those pages on the sidebar. If you're interested in a more in depth look at
my research you can check out blog posts or look at my [GitHub
page](https://github.com/bcaddy); specifically the
[hydro-sandbox](https://github.com/bcaddy/hydro-sandbox) repo where I prototype
hydrodynamics code or at [my fork of Cholla](https://github.com/bcaddy/cholla).
