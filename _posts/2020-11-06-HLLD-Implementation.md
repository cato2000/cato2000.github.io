# General Relativity (GR)
Discussed the Alcubierre metric/warp drive and more digging into curved
spacetime.

# HLLD Solver
Building on the work from [last week]({% post_url 2020-10-30-MHD-Implementation-Prep %}) I finished up the prep work for the HLLD solver. The code is now ready for the HLLD solver implementation so I've been working on that. I haven't finished so I don't have any pretty plots yet. Maybe next week, assuming the USA still exists.
