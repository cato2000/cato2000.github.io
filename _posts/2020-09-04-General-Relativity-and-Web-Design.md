# General Relativity (GR)

This week my GR class started so I spent some time prepping for that. Seems like a solid class, not much to report so far.


# Website
I spent several days this week fixing up this website. Monday was mostly writing the previous two blog posts ([Welcome]({% post_url 2020-08-31-Welcome %}) and [Research So Far]({% post_url 2020-08-31-Research-So-Far %})). Some of my colleagues kindly pointed out that videos weren't working properly on chromium powered browsers and PDFs weren't displaying properly on mobile. Fixing those two issues took a bit longer than expected but I get it resolved and now the website is more portable and more functional.

# Miscellaneous Things
- Started assembling my Ph.D dissertation committee
