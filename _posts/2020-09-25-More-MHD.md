# General Relativity (GR)
Started seriously on special relativity this week. Spent most of Monday on
homework along with parts of Wednesday.


# Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
Spent all of Tuesday and most of Wednesday on this. Reading through Teyssier and
preparing for my presentation on MHD for the computational physics seminar
people. Dug into some more details on Alfvén and magnetosonic waves
("magnetosonic" is easily the coolest word), these 4 extra waves significantly
complicated the solution to the Riemann problem and so an exact solver isn't
really practical at all. The most popular solver is the HLLD solver (Miyoshi &
Kusano 2005) which I will be implementing for my/Cholla's MHD code.

*Note the*
*much more complex wave structure now that the sound waves have split into the*
*fast and slow magnetosonic waves*

# Computational Tools
I spent Thursday writing a C++ class for performance timing. It can be found in
my [hydro-sandbox](https://github.com/bcaddy/hydro-sandbox) in the file named
`PerfTimer.h`. This new timer starts and stops with simple member functions,
handles all the converting and cleaning of timing data, and outputs performance
timing statistics in a neat and clean way. It can also directly save the timing
data so more in depth analysis can be done.

I've started converting my hydro code in
[hydro-sandbox](https://github.com/bcaddy/hydro-sandbox) to use a Van Leer
integrator instead of a CTU integrator so that I can use the VL+CT method for
MHD detailed in Stone & Gardiner 2009.
